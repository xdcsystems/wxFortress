It's a small gaming app, based on sharing OpenGL, OpenAL, wxWidgets, and FFMPEG libraries.</br>
This is specifically designed and optimized for use on slow computers. OpenGL 2.0+ driver only support is required to work.</br>
It's a fully cross-platform app. The build for Windows and Linux is currently tested.</br>
