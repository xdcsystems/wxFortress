# wxFortress
It's a small gaming app, based on sharing OpenGL, OpenAL, wxWidgets, and FFMPEG libraries. 
This is specifically designed and optimized for use on slow computers. 
OpenGL 2.0+ driver only support is required to work. 
It's a fully cross-platform app. The build for Windows and Linux is currently tested. 
Using the wxWidgets library, the application can be easily ported to mobile platforms.
