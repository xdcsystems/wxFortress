# wxFortress
It's a small gaming app, based on sharing OpenGL, OpenAL, wxWidgets, and FFMPEG libraries.</br>
It is specifically designed and optimized for running on slow computers. Only the OpenGL 2.0+ driver support is required to work.</br>
It's a fully cross-platform app. Windows and Linux builds are currently being tested.</br>
Thanks to used libraries, application can be easily ported to mobile platforms too.</br>
CMake build system is used to build the project.</br>
Automated googletests unit tests are connected to the build process.</br>
You can see work of an already assembled application, taking files from the .bin folder
